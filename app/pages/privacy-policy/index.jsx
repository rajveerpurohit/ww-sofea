                                <p>Protecting your privacy is as important to us as it is to you. For us, itâ€™s more than just making sure we comply with the relevant legislation; you trust us with your personal information and we respect that trust. This privacy notice explains why and how we collect, use and store your personal information.

                                <h3>We want you to understand who you are sharing your information with, what kind of information we are collecting and how we use the information.</h3>
                                <p>In your day-to-day dealings with Woolworths we obtain information about you. We want you to know exactly what that information is and what we do with it. After all, trust is nothing without transparency.</p>
                                <h3>We need your information to deliver the right product, at the right time and in the right place.</h3>
